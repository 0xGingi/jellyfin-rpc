### It won't connect to discord!
If you are on Windows then open CMD or PowerShell and run it like this `./jellyfin.exe`, remember to have your .env in the same directory.

### Images aren't working?
Your server needs to be forwarded for this function to work, all the script is doing is basically giving discord the path to the image.

### It looks broken (Windows)
Open in PowerShell instead
